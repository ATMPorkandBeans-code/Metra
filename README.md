Metronome App is an exploration of visual elements in music practice. Rhythm in this app is geometrically represented by a dynamically generated
haxagonal shape that adapts to the user's selected "Beats per Measure". A ball follows the tempo of the shape, travelling along the lines of it
while crossing each "dot" on the hexagon in line with the beat. This should give the user an idea of the "space" in between each click as well as an idea 
of how organizing beats in a measure should "feel". In addition to the heaxongal shape, the UI responds with a "pulse" on the beat 1 of every new measure.
This should give not just the auditory cue to practice with but also an idea of how each meter and tempo "breathes"

To use is dead simple. Use the arrows on either side of the Beats per Minute and Beats per Measure to choose tempo and meter. You can also use a mouse in 
a browser to scroll up and down faster. The Settings Tab includes "Theme" changes for visual variation as well as two different settings for the audio 
output. The Audio should have "Normal" click sounds and "High" which is an octave higher so you can head better depending on the use situation.
